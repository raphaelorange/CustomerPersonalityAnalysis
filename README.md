Customer Personality Analysis: 

This project, developed by the Data Dudes, is aimed at effectively targeting the right customers for marketing campaigns using customer data.

Problem Statement:

Finding the appropriate customers for marketing campaigns is often challenging.

Objective: 
Using acquired customer data ranging from income to age, we aim to determine which customers to target for our marketing campaign and the most suitable platform for presenting it.

Research Question:

Which demographic should we target for a specific type of product? (In this case, wine)

Data Processing and Cleaning:

The data was cleaned and processed to remove any irrelevant information or outliers which might skew the analysis. The processed dataset consists of demographic information, amounts spent on different products, information on customers' purchase behaviors, and data on the success of previous marketing campaigns.

Analysis:

The analysis aims to find the correlation between the amount of wine bought and other customer attributes like Age, Marital status, Number of kids at home, Income, and Date of customer enrollment.

Further analysis investigates whether married couples or people with no kids at home spent the most on wine because they are the majority and what differentiates the clusters in the MDS graph.

Tools Used:

Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib for data visualization.
Sklearn for Machine learning and data processing.

Results:

The results of the project show a correlation between customers with higher incomes and no kids spending the most on wine. The project also demonstrates that college graduates and PhD students are the major consumers of wine and should be the primary targets for wine marketing campaigns.
